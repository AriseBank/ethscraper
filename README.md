# ETHScraper
Simple web dashboard, which tracks transactions for one specified address on the Ethereum blockchain
## Getting started

## Built with
- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) - The web framework used for the dashboard
- [plotly.js](https://plot.ly/javascript/) - The charting library for the plots
- [Etherscan](https://etherscan.io/apis/) - The API used to track Ethereum blockchain transaction data
- [Requests](http://docs.python-requests.org/en/master/) - The HTTP library used to query the Etherscan API
- [pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/) - The data analysis library preparing the dataframes for the plots
## Contributing
Please feel free to fork and submit pull requests. However keep in mind that the project currently focuses on one specific ETH address, which will probably not be changed in the future. Changes requiring a different address are better off in a separate repository.
